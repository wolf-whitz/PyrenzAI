# Security Policy

## TL;DR: Let's keep things nice

We take security seriously This document outlines how we approach security and how you can help keep things safe while using or contributing to this project. Let’s dive in.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Got a bug that might open a backdoor or a vulnerability you’re worried about? Please, don’t hesitate to hit us up:

- **Email**: support@pyrenzai.com
- **Key Points**: Please give us as much info as possible, like steps to reproduce, your environment, and any other stuff to help us fix it faster. The more info you give, the faster we can get it fixed!

We’ll do our best to address security vulnerabilities as quickly as possible and give you a shoutout when it’s fixed (because you’re awesome just like superman).

## Responsible Disclosure

If you find a vulnerability, don’t share it with the whole internet yet. Let’s keep it hush-hush until we can patch things up. When we push a fix, you can spread the word, but until then, please don’t leak it. We’ll keep you in the loop with our fixes.

## Our Security Process

Here’s how we roll:

1. **Assess & Confirm**: If you find a bug, we’ll verify it first and figure out how serious it is.
2. **Patch & Fix**: Once it’s confirmed, we’ll get to work patching things. We’ll try to keep everything under wraps until we’re ready to release the fix.
3. **Celebrate**: Once everything is wrapped up we’ll be giving you credit if your find was big enough. Every hero deserves a shoutout.

## Get Involved

You can help make this project more secure by:

- **Submitting Patches**: Found something? Fix it, fam. Submit a pull request or report the problem.
- **Reporting Bugs**: If you find something sketchy, we’ll appreciate a heads-up!
